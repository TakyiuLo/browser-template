# Objective
Create an e-commerce site for famed retail giant, Nozama.com! Naturally, the site will need to allow customers to see all of Nozama's products, add those items to a shopping cart, and purchase them using Stripe. In addition, by logging in, customers should be able to keep track of their purchases by looking at their past orders.

# Planing
The group start out by planing together for a few hours. We planned the User Stories, Wireframes, and Mongo Data Model. Team split into two, front-end and back-end developers on pair coding. The team is using the SCRUM pattern for the work flow. Every morning, noon, evening we'll have our group meeting to check status on everyone. So everything is build on sprint. We were using Slack and Trello to maintain our communication. The supported guidences were from General Assembly WDI instructors.

# Challenges
The team had over come many challenges. At first, we were on two different path, front and back end. Then we came together and thought of exchanging teammember roles so everyone play a little bit on everything. However, it was quickly rejected due to time limit. The other challenge was to get Stripe working. It took us a whole day to understand it and using it. We weren't able to get it to work with JQuery. Then we put every piece of code into html script tag which is not the best way to do. However, we found out the real framework that get Stripe to work is StripeJS. The problem was we were using one of its component, Stripe Checkout JS. These are two very different framework. At last, we have made our MVP.
